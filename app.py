Hi, my name is Yuecheng Peng. I'm an HCI designer and developer.
        
üßë‚Äçüîß Doing all kinds of handworks is my favorite: fabricating tangible prototypes, exploring potential of various materials, etc.

üìà I also love to tell visual stories with data, offering insights and reflections of the society we live in.
